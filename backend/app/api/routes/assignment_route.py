API Router for Assignment Management

This module provides API endpoints for managing assignments within a course. It includes functionality to create, read, update, and delete assignments. The endpoints utilize FastAPI for routing and SQLAlchemy for database operations. User authentication and active status checks are performed for each operation.

Modules and Functions:
- APIRouter: FastAPI router instance for defining API routes.
- Depends: Dependency injection for request handling.
- Session: SQLAlchemy session for database interactions.
- List: Typing hint for lists.
- get_db: Dependency for obtaining a database session.
- check_user_active: Dependency for checking if the user is active.
- create_assignment: CRUD function for creating a new assignment.
- get_all_assignments: CRUD function for fetching all assignments for a specific course.
- get_assignment: CRUD function for fetching a specific assignment.
- delete_assignment: CRUD function for deleting an assignment.
- update_assignment: CRUD function for updating an assignment.
- AssignmentCreate: Pydantic schema for creating assignments.
- AssignmentRead: Pydantic schema for reading assignment data.
- AssignmentUpdate: Pydantic schema for updating assignments.

Routes:
- POST /assignments: Create a new assignment.
- GET /courses/{course_id}/assignments: Get all assignments for a specific course.
- GET /assignments/{assignment_id}: Get a specific assignment by ID.
- DELETE /assignments/{assignment_id}: Delete an assignment by ID.
- PUT /assignments/{assignment_id}: Update an assignment by ID.
